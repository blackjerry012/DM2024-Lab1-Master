I completed the DM2024-Lab1-Master.ipynb preset for the first step of the job, and changed the subsequent steps 2 to 5 to a different dataset and wrote them in DM2024-Lab1-Master_for step2 to 4(new_dataset).ipynb. The beginning is all about step 2, the second half begins with the analysis of TF-IDF and accuracy, and the last part discusses STEP 4.
